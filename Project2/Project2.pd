\; \; Each row represents a sound and each column represents an instance
of time. Checking any box in a row will play that sound when a bang
in the bang row aligns with that checked box. \; Sequencer is a Pure
Data object so if you would like to open a new instance in another
project just create a new object and type sequencer.;
